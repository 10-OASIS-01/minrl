## Overview
PPO is a policy gradient method that uses a clipped surrogate objective to ensure
stable training. This implementation includes:
- Combined actor-critic architecture
- Clipped surrogate objective
- Value function estimation
- Entropy bonus for exploration

## Implementation Details

### Network Architecture
- Shared feature extractor
- Policy head (actor) with softmax output
- Value head (critic) with scalar output

### Key Components
1. **PPONetwork**: Combined actor-critic neural network
2. **PPOMemory**: Buffer for storing transitions
3. **PPOAgent**: Main agent implementation with PPO logic

### Training Process
1. Collect experiences using current policy
2. Compute advantages and returns
3. Perform multiple epochs of updates with clipped objective
4. Include value loss and entropy bonus

## Usage Example
```python
from src.environment import GridWorld
from src.agents import PPOAgent

# Create environment and agent
env = GridWorld(size=4)
agent = PPOAgent(
    env,
    learning_rate=0.0003,
    clip_ratio=0.2,
    value_coef=0.5,
    entropy_coef=0.01
)

# Train the agent
rewards, lengths = agent.train(n_episodes=1000)

# Get learned policy
policy = agent.get_optimal_policy()
