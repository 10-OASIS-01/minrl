## 🛠️ Dependencies

```bash
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy >= 1.19.0
- PyTorch >= 1.8.0
- Matplotlib >= 3.3.0
- Seaborn >= 0.11.0
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/10-OASIS-01/minrl.git
cd minrl

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### **Basic Usage**

Here’s how you can start using the basic functionality of the library:

```python
from minrl.environment import GridWorld
from minrl.agents import DQNAgent

# Create a 3x3 GridWorld environment
env = GridWorld(size=3)

# Initialize and train a DQN agent
agent = DQNAgent(env)
rewards = agent.train(episodes=1000)

# Visualize the learned policy
agent.visualize_policy()
```

This code sets up a simple **3x3 GridWorld**, trains a **DQN agent** for 1000 episodes, and then visualizes the learned policy.


### **Run Basic Navigation Example**

The **basic_navigation.py** example demonstrates the agent navigating a static GridWorld environment. To run this example:

```bash
# Run the basic navigation example
python -m minrl.examples.basic_navigation
```

This will execute a basic navigation task where the agent tries to learn how to move in the 3x3 GridWorld. It will show how to set up the environment and train a simple agent.


### **Run Experiments with All Implemented Algorithms**

To see how the different RL algorithms (like Q-learning, DQN, etc.) perform on the same environment, you can run **run_experiments.py**. This will execute a full set of experiments and compare the results.

```bash
# Run experiments with all RL algorithms
python -m minrl.examples.run_experiments
```

This command will automatically run experiments for all available RL algorithms, training agents using Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, and other approaches. The results will allow you to compare the performance of each algorithm in the same GridWorld environment.
